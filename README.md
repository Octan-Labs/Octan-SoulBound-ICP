# Octan SoulBound
Octan develops a soulbound token (SBT) framework to 
1. Empower users to seamlessly self-manage their credentials and social profiles across multiple applications and chains. With SBT, users can mint soulbound tokens and link them to their unique Web3 profile, which carries their multi-schema reputation scores and verifiable credential proofs.
2. Unify users' wallets to compute their total reputation scores, which can attract the attention of various projects and communities, resulting in more rewards such as tokens, NFTs, and whitelists. Users can also publish valuable data and earn incentives from the Octan treasury.
3. Allow third parties to access and verify user reputation through bundles without revealing private data.
4. Let users be able to create their on-chain network to track transactions and reputation scores of entities they are interested in and view social insight analytics from their onchain transactions.

Reputation Score is computed and provided by Octan based on user's onchain transactions. Visits Octan Reputation Scoring https://github.com/Octan-Labs/Reputation-scoring
